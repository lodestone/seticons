= Set Icons

Set up custom icons for your macOS Applications without fear that an auto-update will scrap your changes

== Installation:

* Put `bin/seticons` somewhere in your `$PATH` and make it executable.
* Put `config/custom-icons.yaml` in `$HOME/.config/custom-icons.yaml`

Look over the `custom-icons.yaml` file for examples.
